# Welcome to Miami 2100
The megalopolis of Miami was born out of the ashes of Old Florida and tempered in the calamities and international corporate war that marked the 21st century. Now it's the worlds premiere spot to get rich or die trying.
- **2020s** Corporations are given expanded rights and reduced oversight under President Trump, eventually leading to the legal precedence that would establish corporate extraterritoriality.
- **2030s** Climate change leads to humanity's first recorded megacane, which decimates the East coast of America (including Old Florida). Corporations rush in, eager to both impress the world by helping with rebuilding and to trap Caribbean refugees in exploitative employment agreements.
- **2040s** Breakthroughs in quantum technology leads to a global techno-capitalist boom. The first mass driver is built in Miami, allowing for advanced orbital stations and colonisation missions to both the Moon and Mars.
- **2050s** Miami has expanded to the entire region of Old Florida, and is declared to be America's first megalopolis.
- **2060s** The Red Years, marked by 3 distinct and terrifying events: The complete loss of contact with Mars, the volcanic destruction North America, and the appearance of the worlds first psikos. Miami is one of the only cities in North America mostly unharmed by the volcanoes, leading to an influx of desperate refugees as the Federal government collapses. 
- **2070s** Miami is declares itself as an independent city-state, meanwhile international competition and conflict escalates into the first Global Corporate War.
- **2080s** The European Union dissolves, marking the end of the last geopolitical superpower. Though governments still exist, megacorporations are now the most powerful actors on the world stage.
- **2090s** Peace is declared and the Global Corporate War ends. The Global Corporate Agreement Council is formed to maintain peace and mediate corporate disagreements.
- **2100s** Some idiot lancer rolls out of bed in the morning and decides that today's the day that they are finally gonna catch their lucky break (spoiler alert, you're the idiot).
