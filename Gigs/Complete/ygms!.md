# YOU GOT ME SHOT
**Protection (Incredibly ironic, since you managed to get me shot!)** 
**80,000b**
Driver is offering you a job, I guess he was impressed by your little display of violence the other night. You remember that night, don't you? The night that you brought your bullshit into my bar? AND THEN GOT ME SHOT!? FOR NO GOOD GODDAMN REASON!?

Anyway, he's willing to pay for some lancer protection while he runs into one corner of the Red or another. I wasn't really paying attention, I'm afraid I was distracted by this terrible ache in my arm. I wonder what caused that? Oh yeah, it was a FUCKING BULLET. BECAUSE I GOT SHOT BY A SOME FUCK DRESSED UP AS A CARTOON CHARACTER, OVER SOME SHIT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH!

It's a good payday because it's high-risk, and you guys just became my most disposable lancers. If you succeed we all get bitz, and if you fail it's probably because some terrible thing out in the Red killed and ate you. So it's a real win-win for me <3.
# Updates
Driver says you did a great job killing all the people and not-people that got in his way, good job! Kinda sucks for me that none of you died or got unnecessarily shot, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

Don't worry, Driver said he's gonna be recommending you guys to his friends for future gigs since you did just a good job! So there will be lots of opportunities for you guys to be mauled by gay frogsquatches in the future.
