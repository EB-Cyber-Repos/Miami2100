## 3 cheers for animal rights!

Remember PETA from back in the day? Turns out getting us all to eat factory grown meat wasn't enough, now they're fighting for the rights of bio-engineered animals. That's why some treehugger hacker named TH3S35S is willing to pay a pretty penny for you to break in to a BVT synth-meat factory, and jailbreak the mutant cattle they've got caged up. I'm sure nothing could go wrong!

# Updates
TH3S35S posted the footage you got to a Frequency X net, to chorus of hurrahs from conspiracy theorists and shouts of deepfake from everyone else. Whatever, he was happy enough to pay his tab.

By the way, a little birdie told me that BVT is pretty pissed that someone wasted one of their suits in the middle of one of their plants. Apparently they even got footage of the assailants, if I was one of those runners I would find a place to hide out for a while. Of course if I was one of those runners I would never have got my fixer shot either, so what do I know?
