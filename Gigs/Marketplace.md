## Black Market Deals
This is the exclusive merchandise, rare items here for a limited time. Once someone buys it, it's gone:
- Magic 8-Ball - 8,000b - No matter where, no matter when. You can always give the 8-Ball a shack and get some honest advice. Just don't come asking for refund when it gives you bad news.
- PlasmaSaber - 10,000 - The legally distinct Lightsaber, for all your slicing and dicing needs. Robes optional.
- Predator Ring - 12,000b - A twist of the ring, and you disappear like the extraterrestrial antagonist of a 1980's action vid. It's not quite invisible, but it's pretty fucking close.
- H.I.V.E. - 2,000b - A swarm of AI-controlled nanites in a conveniently grenade-sized package. Just give them verbal instructions and let'r rip.
- Amber Alert - 2,000b - This grenade is actually an all-bands alarm system for every government and corpo frequency within radius. If you ever wanted to send out the batsignal for every uniform for several miles, this would be the way to do it.
