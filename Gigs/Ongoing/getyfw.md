# Get your feet wet
**Assassination//Sabotage**
**30,000b**

A client has reached and out and requested the removal of a disruptive neighbour. There's this new club that's popped up in The Yards called Atlantis, popular spot being run by a Mask named Neptune. The client is willing to cough up some serious bitz to close the waterpark early, so that's exactly what you're gonna do.

Masks are all about celebrity, so the client thinks that flatlining Neptune will cause the whole thing to fall apart in a week or two. Killing Neptune isn't a must-do though, apparently the client isn't picky as long as he's out of the neighbourhood.
