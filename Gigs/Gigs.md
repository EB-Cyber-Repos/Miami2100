It's dirty work, but somebody has got to do it. 

## It's 8pm, do you know where your kids are?
**Investigation**
**30,000b**
A client's kid has gone missing, and with the local cops being useless she's engaged us to track him down and get him back. It sounds like this is more of a runaway situation than a kidnapping, but that doesn't you should go in expecting an easy job. With what kids are getting into these days he could be off doing drugs, hanging with a girlfriend, or building a AI mega-virus.

## Gators in the sewers!
**Protection**
**40,000b**
Some nutjob from Frequency X thinks that there monsters living in the sewers, and he wants to get the proof on camera. Apparently the theory is that BVT has been flushing steroids, mutagens, and chemical waste down the drain and that it's infected the various animals that have moved their habitats underground. I think he's an idiot, but that won't stop us me from taking his money.
