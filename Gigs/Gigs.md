## It's 8pm, do you know where your kids are?
**Investigation**
**30,000b**
A client's kid has gone missing, and with the local cops being their usual useless selves she's made the very wise decision to engage our services. It sounds like this is more of a runaway situation than a kidnapping, but that doesn't mean you should go in expecting a cakewalk. With what kids are getting into these days he could be off doing drugs, hiding with a girlfriend, or building an A.I. mega-virus. 

## Gators in the sewers!
**Protection**
**40,000b**
Some nutjob from Frequency X thinks that there are monsters living in the sewers, and he wants to get the proof on camera. The theory goes that BVT has been flushing steroids, mutagens, and chemical waste down the drain and that it has infected the various animals that have moved their habitats underground. 

I think he's an idiot, but that won't stop me from taking his money. Just keep him safe from scavvers while he makes his little documentary, and wash the sewage off your shoes before you walk back into the bar.

## YOU GOT ME SHOT
**Protection (Incredibly ironic, since you managed to get me shot!)** 
**80,000b**
Driver is offering you a job, I guess he was impressed by your little display of violence the other night. You remember that night, don't you? The night that you brought your bullshit into my bar? AND THEN GOT ME SHOT!? FOR NO GOOD GODDAMN REASON!?

Anyway, he's willing to pay for some lancer protection while he runs into one corner of the Red or another. I wasn't really paying attention, I'm afraid I was distracted by this terrible ache in my arm. I wonder what caused that? Oh yeah, it was a FUCKING BULLET. BECAUSE I GOT SHOT BY A SOME FUCK DRESSED UP AS A CARTOON CHARACTER, OVER SOME SHIT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH!

It's a good payday because it's high-risk, and you guys just became my most disposable lancers. If you succeed we all get bitz, and if you fail it's probably because some terrible thing out in the Red killed and ate you. So it's a real win-win for me <3.
