## 3 cheers for animal rights!
**Infiltration**
**60,000b**
Remember PETA from back in the day? Turns out getting us all to eat factory grown meat wasn't enough, now they're fighting for the rights of bio-engineered animals. That's why some treehugger hacker named TH3S35S is willing to pay a pretty penny for you to break in to a BVT synth-meat factory, and jailbreak the mutant cattle they've got caged up. I'm sure nothing could go wrong!

## It's 8pm, do you know where your kids are?
**Investigation**
**40,000b**
A client's kid has gone missing, and with the local cops being their usual useless selves she's made the very wise decision to engage our services. It sounds like this is more of a runaway situation than a kidnapping, but that doesn't mean you should go in expecting a cakewalk. With what kids are getting into these days he could be off doing drugs, hiding with a girlfriend, or building an A.I. mega-virus. 

## Gators in the sewers!
**Protection**
**50,000b**
Some nutjob from Frequency X thinks that there are monsters living in the sewers, and he wants to get the proof on camera. The theory goes that BVT has been flushing steroids, mutagens, and chemical waste down the drain and that it has infected the various animals that have moved their habitats underground. 

I think he's an idiot, but that won't stop me from taking his money. Just keep him safe from scavvers while he makes his little documentary, and wash the sewage off your shoes before you walk back into the bar.
