# Royal Fox

Something flits and darts across branch and leaf with a delicate grace. The smell of spices, exotic and subtle, pass by your nostrils momentarily. A most exquisite fox enters into view, its body adorned in jewelry. Its pelt is fine and clean beyond compare, while its jewelry is untarnished and set with glittering gemstones. Its eyes and face betrays a deep intelligence, and it watches you with caution and curiosity.

A Royal Fox is a creature gifted with the power of complete diplomatic protection. Through cunning and bargains, it has gained the trust and blessing of nearly every 
ruling being within the Hedge. Because of this, they are supernaturally immune to nearly everything, even time itself, so long as they travel within the boundaries of where they enjoy their diplomatic protection.

Appearing as nothing more than a common fox wearing elaborate jewelry, they can speak and understand almost every language and always have the highest of manners. They rarely fight (as they almost never have need to), are competent spellcasters, and are cunning beyond compare. A Royal Fox abhors violence, but is more than willing to make a bloody exception in the name of revenge or a personal slight. 

Due to their invulnerability, they make themselves useful asguides, spies, and ambassadorsto the powerful entities that vie for power within the Hedge. They are even willing to assist adventurers and travellers, provided they offer a substantial payment or the promise of a personal favor. There is little that escapes the ears of a Royal Fox and they are more than happy to provide esoteric information, for the right price.

Their numbers are very few, supposedly only 14 remain alive to this day, and several of them are in the direct employ of demigods and divine beings. Those in direct employ typically relay messages and arrange diplomatic meetings between powerful entities. There are few that are foolish enough to disregard the summons of a Royal Fox, as to do so risks the ire of any number of dangerous beings. 

The Royal Fox is a favored subject amongst storytellers andbards. A group of foxes so smart and cunning that they convinced even Time itself to grant them immunity is too much to ignore when it comes to spinning tales. However, there are darker ballads that speak of them as devious tricksters, speaking half-truths and twisting words to suit their selfish needs or leading people astray at the orders of a higher power. In the end, one idiom rings true across all stories:

*“Be wary of a Royal Fox, it is always ten steps ahead of you.”*
