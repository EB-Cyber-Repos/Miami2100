# The Court of Broken Branches

The wilds are home to many broken things.

Children, abandoned by their parents; beasts left for dead by their pack; deserters, minds shattered by the horrors of war; and common folk, exiled simply for being different.

In the pits of their despair, they cry out for solace, begging and praying for the faintest glimmer of belonging and hope.

Their prayers go unanswered by all. Save for one: The Lady of Broken Branches.

The Lady of Broken Branches, as she is known in this age, has existed since before the dawn of civilization. Appearing as royal lady gone feral, adorned in both kingly jewelry, as well as cobwebs and bones; she is dark in appearance and cold in her demeanor.

She lords over a “court” of countless dejected beings (both animal and human) that fall under the descriptor of “broken”; traumatized army deserters, runty animals, limbless cripples, diseased exiles, and the shunned, all of whom find themselves lost and alone in the deep woods. She takes them in, gives them a place of belonging, and mends them as she sees fit. Because of this, her followers are blindly loyal, eternally loving, and willing to die at a moment's notice for her whims.

Despite her seeming charity, she is far from a benevolent saint and both despises the civilized world as well as demands no disturbance of the natural order within her domain. She is never the first to draw blood against a village or town, so long as they respect her domain and authority. But, if this unspoken pact is broken she sends her subjects against the belligerents instantaneously.

Entire cities have been wiped clean from the history books in this manner; their people gone, their streets empty save for the occasional stain of blood and the newly sprouted undergrowth.

# A Queen of Broken Beings

From atop her throne of antlers and silver thread she rules over the denizens of the Wilds. Under her command are countless vassals, lords, and soldiers sworn to protect her and uphold her will. None dare question her, and many love her as clerics love their god. She is always fair in every action she takes and every command she gives. None who slight her or her rule are unaware of their misdeeds before they are punished. 

She bears a crown of many things, while her skin is covered in dancing runes. Always in her hands are a pair of gently glowing needles, with silk that seems to dance in a wind that isn’t there. The needles are Lurac and Blethram, named after the legendary wolves whose bones were made into the needles; they were her siblings, until a now dead war-god killed them. The silk is a gift from the first spider, who paid it as tribute for a home in the woods; it can mend and trap anything she desires. Her crown is called The Crown of Many Things, a beautiful woven mass of horn, hair, and treasure; it contains a piece or possession of everyone that has ever set foot in the wilds. Her skin is clothed in dark secrets that dance and writhe across her body; every secret of the wild can be found within, except for the lady's own secret, which she holds within herself...

While many hold equal amounts of fear and respect for the Lady of Broken Branches, they all know of her blessing. Those that find themselves broken beyond repair need only pledge their life and call her name in the darkest parts of the wilds. If she deems you worthy, she will mend you with her needles of bone and thread of spider silk, remaking you into a more befitting subject. Those that are mended by her hand will forevermore be her subject, tasked with upholding her commands and defending the wilds until their dying breath. Some call it a cursed life, referring to the gift as the “Curse Stitch,” but those who are mended show only love and fealty to their Lady. 

Every third moon she summons her most trusted and powerful lords, beasts and mortals alike, to her court to hold a council and discuss the state of the wilds and the Hedge. It is from them that she learns all that she needs to know before issuing missives and orders to be carried out at once.

# Peace, If They Will Take It...

While practically a god in all but title, her powers are not limitless. Beyond the reach of the trees and wilderness her power diminishes greatly. The cities and metropolises of civilization are beyond her reach, protected and watched over by powers that rival her own.

It is because of her inability to directly affect the civilized world that she cautiously performs a quiet game of diplomacy. Rather than wage a war against all of civilization, she allows those who seek coexistence or fealty to her court a level of indifference, allowing them free-range as long as they do no harm. She has even allowed small villages and outposts to thrive within the Wilds, provided they pay tribute and keep their numbers in check. Her goal is not destruction or subjugation, but a quiet coexistence for her to watch over.

However, those that fail to conduct themselves as members of the wilds or slight her in some similar fashion find themselves the target of her and her innumerable court. She is quite capable of waging war if need be, and cities that find themselves the target of one of her military campaigns will bear witness to horrors and suffering only the wilds can bring. 

It is from these slights and misgivings that she will actively seek out new or more capable subjects. Rather than wage war she will send one of her trusted subjects to perform some minor or important task. These summons always come in the same fashion: on the first night with a dream of the meeting place, the second night with a wreath of spider silk and twigs, and the third night with a gentle song beckoning them to the meeting place. The “Night Summons” they’re called, and to ignore them means certain doom. 

Night Summons are seen as both a curse and a gift. A “civilized” and superstitious merchant may see it as a death kell, of which there is no escape. Others more attuned to the wilds see it as a great and important trial, to prove yourself before the Lady of the Wilds. Some deepwood hunters can boast to have performed a task for the Lady or one of her subjects, blessed with powers and gifts that rival the archmages. 

The Lady of Broken Branches demands the wilds remain as they are, unchanged, unshackled, and free to grow and prosper. To hinder this is an attack against not only the wilds but her unquestionable authority. Quietly she sits and watches over the wilds.

# The Curse Stitch

Those who are mended by the Lady of Broken Branches find themselves gifted with power or treasure, albeit at the cost of eternal servitude. Forevermore they are marked with a thin stitching of silver that glows faintly like moonlight in the dark. Some see it as a sign to be respected and honored, others to be feared and shunned.
