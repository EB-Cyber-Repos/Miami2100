- **Attack** When you are in a confrontation and you are trying to cause harm to an opponent. Confrontations include conflicts that are physical, social, digital, and psychic.
- **Defend** When you are in a confrontation and you are trying to defend against harm from an opponent. Confrontations include conflicts that are physical, social, digital, and psychic.
