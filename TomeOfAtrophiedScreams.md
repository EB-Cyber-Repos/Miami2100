**NAME:** The Tome of Atrophied Screams

**OBJECT TYPE:** Spellbook

**EFFECT**

Studying this tome allows the reader to discover information about magic, rituals, or spirits related to the Messengers of the Black Shepherd.

**DESCRIPTION** 

This malevolent book is bound in flesh and penned in ichor, simply holding it is enough to fill the air with the heavy stench of a butcher's workshop. It was discovered in the lair of a tribe of Skunk Apes, where it provided the instructions for a vile blood magic ritual that involved sacrificing and exsanguinating still-living creatures.

The book also contained some loose, hand drawn sketches of three individuals: Apollo, Kame, and Uhm.
