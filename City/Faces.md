Miami in 2100 is an attractive place to live for the uber rich, the desperate, and the absolutely insane. Guess which one you aren't.

## Corporations of 2100
- **Benevolence Corp** Same old Catholic church, new coat of paint.
- **Benevolence Corp** BioVitality Technologies is the worlds leading manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, gene-modded crops, and cloned meat.
- **Disney** The House of Mouse doesn't own all media, but they've come closer than anyone else in the world.
- **N-Tech** Ubiquitous and shadowy, N-Tech has their fingers in everything from computing to security. 

## Gangs of Miami
- **Masks** Masks are a weird combination of gangster, vigilante, influencer, and luchador. They hide their real identities and adopt a persona that they build-up to attract groupies and achieve their goals. 
- **Larpers** Socially challenged nerds have always played weird pretend games, but these kids take it to a new level. They use VR tech to enter the datasphere and play their games in digital worlds hosted on local infrastructure. Apparently they used to get bullied and mugged for their tech and toys, till they started carrying real weapons to defend their imaginary games.
- **Frequency X** Frequency X are less of an organized gang and more like para-social gathering of conspiracy theorists. A bunch of terminally online "journalists" who insist that the truth about the sasquatch illuminati is out there. They aren't usually a physical threat, but if they catch you doing anything on camera you better believe it'll end up online.
