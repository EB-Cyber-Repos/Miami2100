Miami in 2100 is an attractive place to live for the uber rich, the desperate, and the absolutely insane. Guess which one you aren't.

## Corporations of 2100
- **Benevolence Corp** When the scales of global power tilted and it became more beneficial to be a corporation than a country, the Vatican started up Benevelonce Corp to represent Catholicism on the world stage. Vatican city still exists and technically the Pope is still in charge, but Benevelonce Corp's CEO seems to make all the decisions that matter these days.

- **BVT** BioVitality Technologies is the worlds leading manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, gene-modded crops, and cloned meat. Be careful how loudly you compare their R&D to Frankenstein, or you may find that your medical prescriptions are suddenly unavailable.
- **Disney** The House of Mouse doesn't own all the media in the world, but they've come closer than anyone else. They also retain the nastiest lawyers money can buy, which basically makes high-ranking Disney corpos above the law.
- **N-Tech** Ubiquitous and shadowy, N-Tech has their fingers in everything from quantum computing to private security forces. They also have better InfoSec and corporate espionage teams than any other corp on earth, which has made them the premier middleman for selling other peoples secrets.  

## Gangs of Miami
- **Masks** Masks are a weird combination of gangster, vigilante, influencer, and luchador. They hide their real identities and adopt a persona that they build-up to attract groupies and achieve their personal goals. 
- **Larpers** Socially challenged nerds have always played weird pretend games, but these kids take it to a new level. They use VR tech to enter the datasphere and play their games in digital worlds hosted on local infrastructure. Apparently they used to get bullied and mugged for their tech and toys, till they started carrying real weapons to defend their imaginary friends. They function as a weird neighbourhood watch in the places where they set up their games.
- **Frequency X** Frequency X is less of an organized gang and more like a para-social network of like-minded conspiracy theorists. They're a bunch of terminally online "journalists" who insist that the truth about the sasquatch illuminati is out there. They aren't usually a physical threat, but if they catch you doing anything on camera you better believe it'll end up online.
