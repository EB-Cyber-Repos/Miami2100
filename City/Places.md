# The Arkham District
![Welcome](Arkham.jpeg)

The Arkham district sits on the northernmost tip of Miami, right on the bleeding edge of the Hot Zone. There are a lot of ways to get chewed up and spit out that close to The Red. A lot of ways that a clever, tough, or lucky lancer could get paid, too.

## The Boroughs
- **Downtown** The centre of business, class, and polite society in Miami. Waving a gun around here is a really good way to attract some really bad attention from Miami's finest, who are more than happy to protect and serve the corpos who want their borough nice and friendly.
- **The Blocks** The megabuildings where 90% of Miami's housed residents live, each one is it's own ecosystem of businesses and gangs. The streets between buildings occasionally break out into open gunfights between rival blocks, to the peril of anyone trying to get home from work.
- **The Border** The heavily guarded border between Miami and devastated remains of the American continent. There are dangerous you can't imagine past this border, but there are also wonders that could set a lancer up for life.
- **The Ports** The shipyards are a mix of corporate shipping and receiving, criminal smugglers, and 
- **The Underground** The tunnels beneath Miami are a mix of subways, sewers, utility lines and homeless cities, all in various levels of maintenance and abandonment. I hope your tetanus shot is up-to-date.
- **The Yards** The industrial yards are the factories, laboratories, datacentres, and power plants where the blue-collar workers of the dystopian future make their living. Mutants and homeless make homes in the cracks between commercial properties, doing their best to avoid detection from the corporate thugs handling facility security.
