# Freelancers
The street-level mercenaries of the 2100's, doing all the dirty work that the corpos, gangs, and plebs can't do themselves. The pay is great, the life expectancy isn't. 
- **Fixers** gab with clients and set up jobs. Some are masterminds who hand pick teams that execute their game plan, others are middlemen with a black book full of contacts. 
- **Hackers** directly plug their brain into VRNets and are the absolute masters of data. If it has a port to jack into or a network to breach, a hacker can get inside it.
- **Kleps** get at the things that others don't want got. If you want bitz, data, or even rep, sometimes the best way is to find somebody who's got it and just steal it for yourself.
- **Medias** are the artists, journalists, comedians, and musicians who speak truth to the plebs of the world. They've got an audience, they've got a story, and they're gonna make a ton of bitz when they put your shit all over their VRNet.
- **Medics** put the pieces back on you that have been blown off, or replace them with shiny chrome upgrades. Remember that for most of these lancers, it's more of Hippocratic suggestion than an actual oath.  
- **Mutants** ate the ass-end of some corpo chemical waste or spent too much time in fallout from The Hot Zone, and now they don't exactly fit in with polite society. There aren't that many ways a mutie can make a fortune, might as well try freelancing.
- **Solos** know that violence is in fact the answer, and that answer should be direct and emphatic. Whether it's a bodyguard, a soldier, an assassin, or an enforcer, the one thing they all share is an expertise in the purest form of conflict resolution.
- **Psikos** have been touched by the weird that's been leaking into the world from The Hot Zone. People used to think they were crazy when all they could do was hear voices and see ghosts, then some psikos started blowing people up with their brains. That's when everyone *knew* they were crazy.
- **Techies** make the all the machines that surround us go bang, beep, and/or vroom. If it has moving parts or an electric current then a techie can mend it (or break it).
